About a few months ago, I was tasked to research a module for Google Coursera, which is the capstone module (Final), 
a dataset from Kaggle was picked, to demonstrate a need for stricter gun laws. Gun violence within the United States 
has been a prevalent subject to bring up, as thousands of people across the country have either access to a gun or know 
someone who owns one. What this research will entail is that this will examine a dataset that spans a few years, 
from 2006 to 2020, which is an expansion of the previous research that I conducted.

Each file is partitioned to where they belong inside relevant folders. For example, the Year 2006 folder will only have
information that is relevant to 2006.
