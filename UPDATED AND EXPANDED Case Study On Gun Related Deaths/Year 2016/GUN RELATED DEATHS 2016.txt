EXCEL WORKBOOK:
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Because of the many rows of data, the data can't really be represented into a chart of any kind
inside Excel. Therefore, I'll rely on Jupyter (R and Python) for analyzing the data.

From Python, running the mean, median, and mode determined that:
- The most gun-related deaths occurred during the month of August (2016).
- Most of the victims were male.
- Most of the victims died at an unspecified/unknown location.
- Most victims were 24-years-old
- Most victims had either their High School Diploma, or GED.
- The police never intervened for most of these incidents.

When comparing this data to the previous year (2015):

- The mean age is lower, but the mode for age (25) is higher in 2016 than in 2015.
- More people died overall in 2016 than in 2015
