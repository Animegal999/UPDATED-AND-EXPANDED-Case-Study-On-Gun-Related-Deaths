EXCEL WORKBOOK:
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Because of the many rows of data, the data can't really be represented into a chart of any kind
inside Excel. Therefore, I'll rely on Jupyter (R and Python) for analyzing the data.

JUPYTER NOTEBOOK (PYTHON and R):
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

From Python, running the mean, median, and mode determined that:
- The most gun-related deaths occurred during the month of July (2010).
- Most of the victims were male.
- Most of the victims died at home.
- Most victims were 21-years-old
- Most victims had either their High School Diploma, or GED.
- The police never intervened for most of these incidents.

When comparing this data to the previous year (2009):

- Mode age of the victims was less, but mean age was higher in 2010 than in 2009.
- More people died overall in 2010.
- No outliers for both years!
